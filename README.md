# Accenture_data
 Read and analyze a client project brief to understand the client and business problem, identify the requirements that need to be delivered, and identify which tasks you need to focus on as a data analyst.

In the simulation I:

- Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture

- Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions

- Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders.
